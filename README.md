# Building the library

Depends on [libwebsockets](https://libwebsockets.org/) and [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON). Build the library with `make`. This should output `libdiscord-c.a`, and `make test` will create a `discord-c-test` executable you can run for QA.

Discord-C was created by Alpha-V. You can contribute issues and PRs to its development [on GitHub](https://github.com/RealAlpha/discord-c).
